		<h4 align="center">Welcome to my all about me page! Here, you'll find some non-work and non-school related information about me. Have a look!</h4>
		<div class="body-font"><br>
			I played competitive Basketball for 5 years, starting at the age of 11.<br> Before that, I played about 3 years of houseleague while playing on school <br>teams as well. In an attempt to develop my skills, I attended workshops hosted <br>by trained professionals, including those on Team Ontario.<br><br>
			Along with Basketball, I also play Table Tennis semi-competitively. I've <br> received training from former Chinese National team players with hopes to not <br> only improve my level of play, but also maintain my health.
